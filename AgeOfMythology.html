            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>Age of mythology is a game that was developed by Ensemble Studios and during October of 2002 it was released to the public by Microsoft Game Studios.
            This game belongs to the category of Real-time Strategy games, alongside Age of Empires, Rise of Nations, Warcraft (I, II, III) and the Total War games.
            What is fascinating about this game is that even though it's almost 20 years old and the graphics are now outdated, tons of players are still spending time
            to build cities, fight wars and enjoy the campaign of Age of Mythology.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2>Mythology</h2>
            <p>Age of Mythology takes place in older times, back when Gods, heroes and monsters were believed to exists. Through this game the player becomes familiar
            with mythical beasts of different civilizations and with godlike figures that they used to worship. For many of us this game was the introduction to mythology
            and many of us actually grew to love these stories and legends. The story follows the king of Atlantis in a journey to stop the Titan Kronos from escaping
            Tartarus. The journey takes him to the lands of Greece and Troy during the Trojan war, to the deserts and pyramids of Egypt and to the frozen mountais and
            burning forges of the people of the north, until eventually returning to his home.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2>Expansions</h2>
            <p>On the final days of September 2003 the first expansion pack of Age of Mythology was released in the form of Age of Mythology: Titans and added
            the Atlanteans to the game. Kronos once again formed a plan to escape his prison and his follower manipulated the former prince and now new king of the Atlanteans into setting
            the rest of the Titans free. <br/>
            The latest installment to the Age of Mythology was the Tale of the Dragon expansion pack that was released during January of 2016. Though the Chinese were
            added to the game this time and brought with them new Gods, monster and heroes, the expansion did not recieve much love from the player base.</p>
