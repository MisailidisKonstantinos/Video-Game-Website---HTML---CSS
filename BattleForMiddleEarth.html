            <p>The world that the author J.R.R Tolkien created in his magnificent books had it's own movie adaptation in the form
            of The Lord of the Rings movie series, a trilogy that shook the fountation of cinematography and gave birth to a whole new genre of movies. Not long after
            though the video games were released and we as the players recieved Action, MMO RPGs and Real-time Strategy games for our enjoyment. Out of all of these games
            the ones that completely changed my childhood was the RTS game called The Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-Earth, and of course the later released The Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-earth II
            and its expansion pack Rise of the Witch King.</p>
                <p>These games were developed by Electronic Arts Los Angeles and the first one was released during December 2004. The Battle for Middle-earth
                provided singleplayer and multiplayer skirmish fights where you had to choose between Gondor, Rohan, Mordor and Isengard. Each of these factions
                had it's own unique heroes based on the story that was told in the books, as long as different units and playstyle for each one. The campaign of the game
                was an accurate depiction of the entire story when the player chose to play as the forces of good, but there was also an alternate storyline in which
                we could control the army of Sauron and capture the One Ring for the Dark Lord in the land of Mordor.</p>
                <p>During March of 2006 the second game was released and new things were added to this RTS masterpiece and the best one was the new maps. The players
                could finally choose great cities from the Lord of the Rings universe as their castles and fight epic battles. The campaign was changed and was now shorter
                but the idea of the alternate story was still there. One more thing that was added was the Hero Creation where we could create our own hero units
                with the abilities and statistics that we wanted. In game both we and our enemies could hunt Golum and retrieve the One Ring from him in order to summon a powerful
                and expensive Hero Unit in the form of Galadriel for Men, Dwarves and Elves and Sauron for Mordor, Isengard and Goblins.
                Finally the War of the Ring format was amazing, we controled units all over Middle-earth to be able to
                defeat our foes... and I have to admit that it was challenging to do so.</p>
                <p>Finally during November of 2006 the expansion pack for The Battle for Middle-earth II was released with the name: Rise of the Witch-King. This pack
                added Angmar as a playable faction with new Hero units and a new unique playstyle and it was ruled by the Heir of Sauron himself. A new campaign was added, though this time there was not an alternate story.
                The rest of the game was basically the same as it's predecessor.</p>
                <p>But the saddest part of this game is that EA did not pay for the lisence to this game's title and so these games are no longer available on the store.
                The only people that can still get to play the Battle for Middle-earth series are those who bought them years ago.</p></div>
