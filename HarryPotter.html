            <p>The extraordinary fantasy world of the Harry Potter books created by the author J.K Rowling reached the gaming platforms
            with the development of an enormous number of games by Electronic Arts, splitted between PlayStation 1, PlayStation2 and PC. On this WebSite though, we are going
            to focus on the PC releases of the first two games sinced they marked our childhood with fun memories that even to this day we feel nostalgic about.
            But once again due to EA not paying for the trademark, these games are now not available in the market.

            <h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001)</h2>
            <p>The first game released for Windows, the Philosopher's Stone perfectly captured they magic of the Harry Potter universe. The players control the
            Boy who lived and dive into the Wizarding World. We meet Ron and Hermione as our best friends as long as members of the Wesley family and professor Dumbledore.
            We get to attend classes and learn a variety of spells from our beloved professors, except Snape, even in the game he is mean.<br/>
            Hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizardry is filled with secrets, hidden behind walls, portraits and hidden passages that await to be discovered.
            We can also collect Wizard Cards of famous Wizards, but only when we collect all 25 of them we get to find the last and most unique card of them all.
            Finally we defeat the Dark Lord and prevent him from getting the Elixir of Life in a challenging battle between two sworn enemies.</p>

            <h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)</h2>
            <p>Harry's adventure continues on the second game of the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Released just a year later, this game is a
            perfect continuation to the first game. It kept all of the best qualities of Harry Potter and the Philoshopher's Stone and improved them or even added
            more unique things to them. We as the player once again follow Harry Potter and his most trusted friends on an adventure to stop the attacks that have
            been happening all around the castle. <br/>
            We learn new spells that will later help us complete the game and discover more secrets.<br/>
            Hogwarts is now a more "open world" place since it is not always based on the stage of the game you play. Of course every challenge is its own seperate
            part of the castle and some them can not be replayed, but the rest of the castle is always available and you can just spend some time walking and looking
            for hidden places, new undiscovered secrets that can be reached by unlocking new spells, and you can even trade all-flavored beans in order to buy
            ingredients for potions, or even better Famous Witches and Wizard Cards. <br/>
            Finally, my favorite addition to this game is the duelling club where you get to compete against students of each house and climb the ladder to be
            the best duelist that the school has seen since it's creation.</p>
