            <p>Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a game that was developed by Rockstar North and published during October of 2004 by Rockstar Games.
            There is a huge difference between this game and every other game in this website, and this difference is the fact that GTA San Andreas
            take place in America and during the 90's, while the rest of the games take place in imaginary worlds.
            The game revolves around a war between 3 gangs and our protagonist, CJ (aka Carl Johnson) is a member
            of the Grove Street gang alongside his brother Sweet. While the story progresses we face betrayal, deaths of people close to us and constant gang wars
            until we finally have our face off against the traitor Big Smoke and officer Tempeny. We get to travel between 3 different cities and make alliances
            with powerful individuals but also quite a number of enemies. <br/>
            For many people this game was one of their first gaming experiences and almost the entire world is familiar with either the story or the memes that
            came out of this video game.</p>

            <p>Even though the story of Carl Johnson wrapped up during this game, we got ourselves many easter eggs throughout the rest of the Grand Theft Auto games
            such as GTA 4 and GTA 5. GTA 5 takes place in Los Santos, the city that the Grove Street gang existed and the story continues, same as the fued between
            the Ballas and the Grove Street members.<br/>
            Also as a fan fact we have to mention that there is a huge amount of mods for GTA San Andreas and GTA 5 that either add characters from the other games
            or provide a alternate ending that some times is amazing.<br/>
            As a final note we would like to add that this game is based on real life wars between gangs and the involvement of the police to stop these fights. Perhaps
            the story of the game is not entirely true but it is based of events that have happened or could happen in the real world.</p>
