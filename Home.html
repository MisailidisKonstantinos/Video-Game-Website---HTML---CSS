            <h1>Video Games of our childhood</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Video games are a part of our daily lives since the release of the very first video game. They provided each player with tons of joyful moments and a lot of memories
            that they will hold dear for the rest of their days. That is the reason that most of us feel nostalgic towards video games that we used to play in our childhood and we often
            return to these games to relive our happiest memories in the world that they provide.</p>
            <h2>About this website</h2>
            <p>I created this website as a part of a project that was assigned to me when I was studying at college, but it quickly became a fun way to share my love
            for older video games with you. In this website I will talk about 5 of my favorite video game titles of all time. I hope that you will enjoy visiting the first website
            I created.</p>
